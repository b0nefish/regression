First to all, I would like to thank to N1k-o for allowing me to use his fantastic track "Got spacesuit, ready to travel!". It needs to be optimized to fit the 16k page with my custom VortexTracker player plus some minor changes was made in stop-time.
Huge thanks to ellvis of ZeroTeam for his great ideas and design images that inspired me and leads to many effects for last 5 years.
Thanks to Busy for his long-term support and knowledge transfer while our every meeting and he also helping me while developing demo-loader for BS-DOS.
I would like to thank all my friends from SinDiKat, especially ikon and z00m, my closest collaborators and supporters.
Last but not least I thank to all friends from GembaBoys for years of scening together - it was cool experience.
